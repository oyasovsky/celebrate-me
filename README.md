# Celebrate Me

This project is a playful React web app backed by Firebase. It creates a personalized birthday celebration experience for software teams. All UI logic runs on the front end and data about each session is stored in Firestore via Firebase Functions.

## Development

1. Install dependencies for the Firebase functions and the web app. (Requires internet access.)
2. Deploy hosting and functions with Firebase CLI:

```sh
firebase deploy
```

During development you can serve the web files locally with any HTTP server.
